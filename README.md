## Critical styles
This framework is also able to split up into two parts. A critical part and a non-cirical part. So if you load your page with the critical part first and the non-ciritcal part afterwards you will be able to provide the visitor your content even if the site hasn't loaded completely. This works over variables so you could use this splitting up method on your whole stylesheet.
